# Filepath manipulation library for elm

This is largely a rewrite of the `filepath` Haskell package.

Not all functions have been moved over yet, a lot of Windows Drive specific functionality does not work yet, which makes especially the Windows part of this package very experimental.

Help with finishing it is appreciated.
