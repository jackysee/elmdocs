# Geolocation in Elm

Your client code is running on someone's device somewhere in the world. This library helps you find out *where* that device happens to be. If you are lucky, it may even tell you how fast the device is moving!

It is based on the [JavaScript Geolocation API][geo]. You can read about how to use libraries with tasks and subscriptions in [guide.elm-lang.org](http://guide.elm-lang.org/), particularly the section on [The Elm Architecture](http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/index.html).
