Trampolines\npermit unbounded recursion despite limitations in JavaScript.\n\nThis strategy may create many intermediate closures, which is very expensive in\nJavaScript, so use this library only when it is essential that you recurse deeply.\n\n# Trampolines\n@docs Trampoline, done, jump, evaluate\n",
