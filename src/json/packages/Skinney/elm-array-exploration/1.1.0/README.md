# Elm array exploration

This library explores an alternate Array implementation for Elm, using as little native code as possible.
Please check [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AeAefcko0x5Xqz_6GlNwk3GtQ0MzCNR1_jx9TUQkik4)
for a thorough explanation the underlying implementation.

## Use

This package is a drop-in replacement to the array implementation in Elm core.
To use, simply `import Array.Hamt as Array` instead of `import Array`.
