# Elm Retroactive

This library lets you have a retroactive model. This means you can undo / redo
changes in your model. Retroactive means you can have different branches of future (redo).

# Examples

In the `examples` folder you can find minimal examples on how to use the library:

- `Counter.elm` shows how to use the library using `program`.
- `CounterNoProgram.elm` shows how to use the library not using `program`, but instead integrating it on a bigger app.
