# GraphicSVG

A library for creating SVG graphics in a way that is compatible with Elm's
old Graphics library. Also includes built-in functions for creating games and
other applications including keyboard presses and mouse movements. This library
was created for use in McMaster University's Computing and Software Outreach program 
(http://outreach.mcmaster.ca) and CompSci 1JC3. 

See its Elm documentation for more information: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/MacCASOutreach/graphicsvg/latest/GraphicSVG
