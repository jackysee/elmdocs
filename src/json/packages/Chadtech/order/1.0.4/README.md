# DEPRECIATED

Use [this package](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Chadtech/unique-list/latest). Its the same package with a better name. `Order` conflicts with `Basics.Order`, and isnt that informative anyway.

# Elm-Order, A type to arrange things in order

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Chadtech/order.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Chadtech/order)


An `Order` is like a list, but it cannot have duplicate entries. It is also like a `Set`, except the elements are in order.
