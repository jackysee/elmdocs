# AD - BS

This is an AD <-> BS date converter in Elm. It is hugely based on https://github.com/techgaun/ad-bs-converter and https://github.com/shritesh/nepdate.


All BS dates are expressed in the Miti Type and all AD dates are expressed in the core Date type. As of now this library doesn't handle time, only dates.
