# DEPRECATED elm-stringify


An example of using stringify through Native. Published as a module with `toString` enabled, originally based on an approach of parsing the `toString` of the code - but then reverted due to the fact that will not work effectively. You can [see](https://github.com/eeue56/elm-server-side-renderer/blob/master/src/ServerSide/Helpers.elm#L54) that approach - but it's not a good one. So now this package is just `toString`
JSON.stringify for Elm
