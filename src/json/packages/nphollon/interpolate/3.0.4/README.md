# Spline Interpolation

This is a library for doing [cubic spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation). It requires the data to be evenly spaced. Works for one- and two-dimensional data sets!

If you find this library useful, please let me know! It satisfies my needs as-is, but I will respond to feature requests.
