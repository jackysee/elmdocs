Collision
=========

A 3D collision-detection library for Elm. For use with [nphollon/geo3d](package.elm-lang.org/packages/nphollon/geo3d/latest).

This library uses the [OBBTree](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/SSV/obb.pdf) algorithm. It is designed to work well for rigid objects &mdash; objects that move and rotate in 3D space, but do not change their shape.
