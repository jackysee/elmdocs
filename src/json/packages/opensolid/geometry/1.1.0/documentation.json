    "comment": " <img src=\"https://opensolid.github.io/images/geometry/icons/frame3d.svg\" alt=\"Frame3d\" width=\"160\">\n\nA `Frame3d` has an origin point and a set of X, Y and Z directions (which are\nalways perpendicular to each other). It can be thought of as:\n\n  - A local coordinate system: Most geometric types have associated `relativeTo`\n    and `placeIn` functions that convert values of that type from global\n    coordinates to local coordinates in a particular frame, and vice versa.\n  - A set of axes and planes: It is often convenient to (for example) rotate\n    around the Z axis of a frame, or mirror across its XY plane. Frames can\n    also themselves be translated, rotated and mirrored!\n  - A combined 3D position and orientation: For example, a `Frame3d` could be\n    used to define the position and orientation of a spaceship in a 3D game.\n    Movement of the ship would then be done by translating and rotating the\n    frame.\n\nFrames can by constructed by passing a record with `originPoint`, `xDirection`,\n`yDirection` and `zDirection` fields to the `Frame3d` constructor, for example:\n\n    frame =\n        Frame3d\n            { originPoint = Point3d ( 2, 1, 3 )\n            , xDirection = Direction3d ( 0.8, 0.6, 0 )\n            , yDirection = Direction3d ( -0.6, 0.8, 0 )\n            , zDirection = Direction3d ( 0, 0, 1)\n            }\n\nIn this case **you must be careful to ensure that the X, Y and Z directions are\nperpendicular**. (You will likely also want to make sure that they form a\n[right-handed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Orientation_and_handedness)\ncoordinate system.)\n\n# Predefined frames\n\n@docs xyz\n\n# Constructors\n\n@docs at\n\n# Accessors\n\n@docs originPoint, xDirection, yDirection, zDirection\n\n# Axes\n\n@docs xAxis, yAxis, zAxis\n\n# Planes\n\nThe following functions all return planes with the same origin point as the\ngiven plane, but with varying normal directions. In each case the normal\ndirection of the resulting plane is given by the cross product of the two\nindicated basis directions (assuming a right-handed frame); for example,\n\n    Frame3d.xyPlane Frame3d.xyz\n    --> Plane3d\n    -->     { originPoint = Point3d.origin\n    -->     , normalDirection = Direction3d.z\n    -->     }\n\nsince the cross product of the X and Y basis directions of a frame is equal to\nits Z basis direction. And since reversing the order of arguments in a cross\nproduct reverses the sign of the result,\n\n    Frame3d.yxPlane Frame3d.xyz\n    --> Plane3d\n    -->     { originPoint = Point3d.origin\n    -->     , normalDirection = Direction3d.flip Direction3d.z\n    -->     }\n\n@docs xyPlane, yxPlane, yzPlane, zyPlane, zxPlane, xzPlane\n\n# Sketch planes\n\nThese functions all form a `SketchPlane3d` from two axes of the given frame. The\nX and Y axes of the sketch plane will correspond to the two indicated axes. For\nexample,\n\n    Frame3d.yzSketchPlane Frame3d.xyz\n    --> SketchPlane3d\n    -->     { originPoint = Point3d.origin\n    -->     , xDirection = Direction3d.y\n    -->     , yDirection = Direction3d.z\n    -->     }\n\nNote that this can be confusing - for example, a local X coordinate in the above\nsketch plane corresponds to a global Y coordinate, and a local Y coordinate\ncorresponds to a global Z coordinate!\n\n@docs xySketchPlane, yxSketchPlane, yzSketchPlane, zySketchPlane, zxSketchPlane, xzSketchPlane\n\n# Transformations\n\n@docs flipX, flipY, flipZ, moveTo, rotateAround, rotateAroundOwn, translateBy, translateAlongOwn, mirrorAcross\n\n# Coordinate frames\n\n@docs relativeTo, placeIn\n",

Sketch planes are the primary tool for converting\nback and forth between 2D and 3D coordinates:\n\n  - 3D geometry such as points, directions and line segments can be projected\n    _into_ a sketch plane, which effectively projects the geometry _onto_ the\n    sketch plane and then expresses the projected geometry _in_ 2D coordinates.\n  - 2D geometry can be place _onto_ a sketch plane to result in 3D geometry. For\n    example, a 2D point placed onto a sketch plane will result in a 3D point\n    _on_ that sketch plane that has the given 2D coordinate _in_ the sketch\n    plane.\n\nMany 3D data types have `projectInto` functions that return the corresponding 2D\ndata type, and those 2D data types have `placeOnto` functions for converting\nback to 3D. For example, [`Triangle3d.projectInto`](OpenSolid-Triangle3d#projectInto)\nreturns a `Triangle2d` and [`Triangle2d.placeOnto`](OpenSolid-Triangle2d#placeOnto)\nreturns a `Triangle3d`. These pairs of functions are almost, but not quite,\ninverses of each other:\n\n  - <code>Point2d.placeOnto&nbsp;sketchPlane&nbsp;>>&nbsp;Point3d.projectInto&nbsp;sketchPlane</code>\n    will just return the original `Point2d` (within roundoff error).\n  - <code>Point3d.projectInto&nbsp;sketchPlane&nbsp;>>&nbsp;Point2d.placeOnto&nbsp;sketchPlane</code>\n    is equivalent to <code>Point3d.projectOnto&nbsp;(SketchPlane3d.plane&nbsp;sketchPlane)</code>\n    since the result will always be on the given sketch plane.\n\nSketch planes can be constructed explicitly by passing a record with\n`originPoint`, `xDirection` and `yDirection` fields to the `SketchPlane3d`\nconstructor, for example\n\n    sketchPlane =\n        SketchPlane3d\n            { originPoint = Point3d ( 2, 1, 3 )\n            , xDirection = Direction3d.y\n            , yDirection = Direction3d.flip Direction3d.z\n            }\n\nIf you construct a `SketchPlane3d` this way, **you must ensure that the X and Y\nbasis directions are perpendicular to each other**.\n\n# Predefined sketch planes\n\nThese predefined sketch planes all have the global origin point as their origin\npoint, and use the two indicated global axes as their X and Y axes. For example,\n\n    SketchPlane3d.yz\n    --> SketchPlane3d\n    -->     { originPoint = Point3d.origin\n    -->     , xDirection = Direction3d.y\n    -->     , yDirection = Direction3d.z\n    -->     }\n\n@docs xy, yx, yz, zy, zx, xz\n\n# Accessors\n\n@docs originPoint, xDirection, yDirection, normalDirection\n\n# Axes\n\n@docs xAxis, yAxis, normalAxis\n\n# Conversions\n\n@docs plane\n\n# Transformations\n\n@docs flipX, flipY, moveTo, rotateAround, rotateAroundOwn, translateBy, translateAlongOwn, mirrorAcross\n\n# Coordinate frames\n\n@docs relativeTo, placeIn\n",

It can be thought of as:\n\n  - A local coordinate system: Most geometric types have associated `relativeTo`\n    and `placeIn` functions that convert values of that type from global\n    coordinates to local coordinates in a particular frame, and vice versa.\n  - A pair of X and Y axes: It is often convenient to (for example) mirror\n    across the X axis of a frame, or project onto its Y axis. Frames can\n    also themselves be translated, rotated and mirrored!\n  - A combined 2D position and orientation: For example, a `Frame2d` could be\n    used to define the position and orientation of a spaceship in a 2D game.\n    Movement of the ship would then be done by translating and rotating the\n    frame.\n\nFrames can by constructed by passing a record with `originPoint`, `xDirection`\nand `yDirection` fields to the `Frame2d` constructor, for example:\n\n    frame =\n        Frame2d\n            { originPoint = Point2d ( 2, 3 )\n            , xDirection = Direction2d.fromAngle (degrees 45)\n            , yDirection = Direction2d.fromAngle (degrees 135)\n            }\n\nIn this case **you must be careful to ensure that the X and Y directions are\nperpendicular**.\n\n# Predefined frames\n\n@docs xy\n\n# Constructors\n\n@docs at\n\n# Accessors\n\n@docs originPoint, xDirection, yDirection\n\n# Axes\n\n@docs xAxis, yAxis\n\n# Transformations\n\n@docs flipX, flipY, moveTo, rotateBy, rotateAround, translateBy, translateAlongOwn, mirrorAcross\n\n# Coordinate frames\n\n@docs relativeTo, placeIn\n",

It is possible to generate bounding boxes for most geometric\nobjects; for example, [`Triangle3d.boundingBox`](OpenSolid-Triangle3d#boundingBox)\ntakes a `Triangle3d` and returns a `BoundingBox3d` that contains that triangle.\nThere are several use cases where it is more efficient to deal with the bounding\nbox of an object than the object itself, such as:\n\n  - Intersection checking: If (for example) the bounding boxes of a line segment\n    and a triangle do not overlap, then the line segment and triangle cannot\n    possibly intersect each other. Expensive intersection checking therefore\n    only has to be performed for line segments and triangles whose bounding\n    boxes _do_ overlap.\n  - 3D rendering: When rendering a 3D scene, any object whose bounding box is\n    not visible must itself be not visible, and therefore does not have to be\n    drawn. This provides a simple form of culling.\n\nBounding boxes can be constructed by passing a record with `minX`, `maxX`,\n`minY`, `maxY`, `minZ` and `maxZ` fields to the `BoundingBox3d` constructor, for\nexample\n\n    exampleBox =\n        BoundingBox3d\n            { minX = -2\n            , maxX = 2\n            , minY = 2\n            , maxY = 5\n            , minZ = 3\n            , maxZ = 4\n            }\n\nIf you construct a `BoundingBox3d` this way, **you must ensure that the given\nvalues are properly ordered**: <code>minX&nbsp;<=&nbsp;maxX</code>,\n<code>minY&nbsp;<=&nbsp;maxY</code>, <code>minZ&nbsp;<=&nbsp;maxZ</code>.\nAlternately, you can construct bounding boxes using functions such as\n[`Point3d.hull`](OpenSolid-Point3d#hull) where the input order does not matter.\n\n# Constructors\n\n@docs singleton, containing\n\n# Accessors\n\n@docs extrema, minX, maxX, minY, maxY, minZ, maxZ\n@docs dimensions, midX, midY, midZ, centroid\n\n# Checks\n\n@docs contains, overlaps, isContainedIn\n\n# Boolean operations\n\n@docs hull, intersection\n",

It is possible to generate bounding boxes for most geometric\nobjects; for example, [`Triangle2d.boundingBox`](OpenSolid-Triangle2d#boundingBox)\ntakes a `Triangle2d` and returns a `BoundingBox2d` that contains that triangle.\nThere are several use cases where it is more efficient to deal with the bounding\nbox of an object than the object itself, such as:\n\n  - Intersection checking: If (for example) the bounding boxes of a line segment\n    and a triangle do not overlap, then the line segment and triangle cannot\n    possibly intersect each other. Expensive intersection checking therefore\n    only has to be performed for line segments and triangles whose bounding\n    boxes _do_ overlap.\n  - 2D rendering: When rendering a 2D scene, any object whose bounding box does\n    not overlap the viewing area must itself be completely outside the viewing\n    area, and therefore does not have to be drawn. This provides a simple form\n    of culling.\n\nBounding boxes can be constructed by passing a record with `minX`, `maxX`,\n`minY` and `maxY` fields to the `BoundingBox2d` constructor, for example\n\n    exampleBox =\n        BoundingBox2d\n            { minX = 3\n            , maxX = 8\n            , minY = 2\n            , maxY = 6\n            }\n\nIf you construct a `BoundingBox2d` this way, **you must ensure that the given\nvalues are properly ordered**: <code>minX&nbsp;<=&nbsp;maxX</code>,\n<code>minY&nbsp;<=&nbsp;maxY</code>. Alternately, you can construct bounding\nboxes using functions such as [`Point2d.hull`](OpenSolid-Point2d#hull) where the\ninput order does not matter.\n\n# Constructors\n\n@docs singleton, containing\n\n# Accessors\n\n@docs extrema, minX, maxX, minY, maxY\n@docs dimensions, midX, midY, centroid\n\n# Checks\n\n@docs contains, overlaps, isContainedIn\n\n# Boolean operations\n\n@docs hull, intersection\n",

This module contains a variety of\nvector-related functionality, such as\n\n  - Adding or subtracting vectors\n  - Finding the lengths of vectors\n  - Rotating vectors\n  - Converting vectors between different coordinate systems\n\nNote that unlike in many other geometry packages where vectors are used as a\ngeneral-purpose data type, OpenSolid has separate data types for vectors,\ndirections and points. In most code it is actually more common to use `Point3d`\nand `Direction3d` than `Vector3d`, and much code can avoid working directly with\n`Vector3d` values at all!\n\nThe simplest way to create a `Vector3d` is by passing a tuple of X, Y and Z\ncomponents to the `Vector3d` constructor, for example\n\n    vector =\n        Vector3d ( 2, 1, 3 )\n\n# Predefined vectors\n\n@docs zero\n\nAlthough there are no predefined constants for\n<code>Vector3d&nbsp;(&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0&nbsp;)</code>,\n<code>Vector3d&nbsp;(&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0&nbsp;)</code> and\n<code>Vector3d&nbsp;(&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1&nbsp;)</code>, in most cases you\nwill actually want their `Direction3d` versions [`Direction3d.x`](OpenSolid-Direction3d#x),\n[`Direction3d.y`](OpenSolid-Direction3d#y) and [`Direction3d.z`](OpenSolid-Direction3d#z).\n\n# Constructors\n\n@docs perpendicularTo\n\n# Components\n\n@docs components, xComponent, yComponent, zComponent, componentIn\n\n# Comparison\n\n@docs equalWithin\n\n# Length and direction\n\n@docs length, squaredLength, direction, lengthAndDirection\n\n# Arithmetic\n\n@docs sum, difference, dotProduct, crossProduct\n\n# Transformations\n\nNote that for all transformations, only the orientation of the given axis or\nplane is relevant, since vectors are position-independent.

This module contains a variety of\nvector-related functionality, such as\n\n  - Adding or subtracting vectors\n  - Finding the lengths of vectors\n  - Rotating vectors\n  - Converting vectors between different coordinate systems\n\nNote that unlike in many other geometry packages where vectors are used as a\ngeneral-purpose data type, OpenSolid has separate data types for vectors,\ndirections and points. In most code it is actually more common to use `Point2d`\nand `Direction2d` than `Vector2d`, and much code can avoid working directly with\n`Vector2d` values at all!\n\nThe simplest way to create a `Vector2d` is  by passing a tuple of X and Y\ncomponents to the `Vector2d` constructor, for example\n\n    vector =\n        Vector2d ( 2, 3 )\n\nThere are no specific functions to create vectors from polar components, but you\ncan use Elm's built-in [`fromPolar`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Basics#fromPolar)\nfunction:\n\n    vector =\n        Vector2d (fromPolar ( radius, angle ))\n\n# Predefined vectors\n\n@docs zero\n\nAlthough there are no predefined constants for\n<code>Vector2d&nbsp;(&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0&nbsp;)</code> and\n<code>Vector2d&nbsp;(&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1&nbsp;)</code>, in most cases you will\nactually want their `Direction2d` versions [`Direction2d.x`](OpenSolid-Direction2d#x)\nand [`Direction2d.y`](OpenSolid-Direction2d#y).\n\n# Constructors\n\n@docs perpendicularTo\n\n# Components\n\n@docs components, xComponent, yComponent, componentIn\n\n# Comparison\n\n@docs equalWithin\n\n# Length and direction\n\n@docs length, squaredLength, direction, lengthAndDirection\n\n# Arithmetic\n\n@docs sum, difference, dotProduct, crossProduct\n\n# Transformations\n\nNote that for `mirrorAcross` and `projectOnto`, only the direction of the axis\naffects the result, since vectors are position-independent. Think of\nmirroring/projecting a vector across/onto an axis as moving the vector so its\ntail is on the axis, then mirroring/projecting its tip across/onto the axis.\n\n@docs flip, scaleBy, rotateBy, mirrorAcross, projectionIn, projectOnto\n\n# Coordinate frames\n\nFunctions for transforming vectors between local and global coordinates in\ndifferent coordinate frames. Like other transformations, coordinate conversions\nof vectors depend only on the orientations of the relevant frames, not the\npositions of their origin points.\n\nFor the examples, assume the following frame has been defined:\n\n    rotatedFrame =\n        Frame2d.rotateBy (degrees 30) Frame2d.xy\n\n@docs relativeTo, placeIn\n\n# Sketch planes\n\n@docs placeOnto\n",

For positions,\n`Point2d` or `Point3d` should be used instead.\n\n@docs Vector2d, Vector3d\n\n# Directions\n\nA direction is effectively a vector with a length of one, used to represent\nquantities like the direction of an axis or the normal direction of a plane.\n\n@docs Direction2d, Direction3d\n\n# Points\n\nPoints represent positions in space. They are distinct from vectors but interact\nwith them in well-defined ways; you can translate a point by a vector to result\nin a new point, or you can compute the vector from one point to another, but you\ncannot 'add' two points like you can add two vectors.\n\n@docs Point2d, Point3d\n\n# Datums\n\nAxes and planes are used extensively within OpenSolid to define different types\nof transformations. For instance, rotation in 3D is defined by a rotation axis\nand mirroring in 3D is defined by a mirror plane.\n\n@docs Axis2d, Axis3d, Plane3d\n\n# Frames\n\nFrames represent local coordinate systems, and allow for conversions between\nlocal and global coordinates. They are also a common source of datums used in\ntransformations, for example rotating around the Z axis of a 3D frame or\nmirroring across its XY plane.\n\n@docs Frame2d, Frame3d\n\n# Sketch planes\n\n@docs SketchPlane3d\n\n# Line segments\n\n@docs LineSegment2d, LineSegment3d\n\n# Triangles\n\n@docs Triangle2d, Triangle3d\n\n# Bounding boxes\n\nThese types represent bounding boxes around other geometric objects, and are\nuseful for tasks such as fast spatial searching or culling non-visible objects\nduring 3D rendering.\n\n@docs BoundingBox2d, BoundingBox3d\n\n# Polylines\n\n@docs Polyline2d, Polyline3d\n\n# Polygons\n\n@docs Polygon2d\n\n# Circles\n\n@docs Circle2d\n",
