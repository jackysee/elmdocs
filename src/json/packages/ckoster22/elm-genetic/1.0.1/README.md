# A Genetic Algorithm written in Elm

## Concepts

A **Genetic Algorithm** is an algorithm that can find a *good enough* solution to an optimization problem.

The core of the algorithm contains a lot of boilerplate and this package aims to hide that boilerplate so that you can instead focus on solving problems with your genetic algorithm.
