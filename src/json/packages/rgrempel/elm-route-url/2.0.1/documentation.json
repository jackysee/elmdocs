The only required changes are in your `Main` module.\n\nEssentially, instead of using the old `start` method and sending the resulting\nsignal to a port, you would now use [`program`](#program) or\n[`programWithFlags`](#programWithFlags), and assign the resulting `Program`\nto your `main` function.\n\nAt your leisure, you should transition to the new `RouteUrl` API, which allows\nyou to use the whole URL (rather than just the hash), since this old API will\nbe removed in a future version of elm-route-url.\n\n# Configuration\n\n@docs Config, ConfigWithFlags, defaultPrefix\n\n# Helpers for `HashUpdate`\n\n@docs HashUpdate, set, replace, apply, map, extract\n\n# Simple Initialization\n\n@docs program, programWithFlags\n\n# Complicated Initialization (usually not needed)\n\n@docs app, appWithFlags\n\n",

        "comment": " Represents the configuration necessary to use this module.\n\n*  `prefix` is the initial characters that should be stripped from the hash (if\n    present) when reacting to location changes, and added to the hash when\n    generating location changes. Normally, you'll likely want to use\n    [`defaultPrefix`](#defaultPrefix), which is \"#!/\".\n\n*   `delta2update` is a function which takes two arguments and possibly\n    returns a [`HashUpdate`](#HashUpdate). The first argument is the previous\n    model. The second argument is the current model.\n\n    The reason you are provided with both the previous and current models is\n    that sometimes the nature of the location update depends on the difference\n    between the two, not just on the latest model. For instance, if the user is\n    typing in a form, you might want to use [`replace`](#replace) rather than\n    [`set`](#set). Of course, in cases where you only need to consult the\n    current model, you can ignore the first parameter.\n\n    This module will normalize the `List String` in the update in the following\n    way before setting the actual location. It will:\n\n    * uriEncode the strings\n    * join them with \"/\"\n    * add the `prefix` to the beginning\n\n    In a modular application, you may well want to use [`map`](#map) after dispatching\n    to a lower level -- see the example in the [`map` documentation](#map).\n\n    Note that this module will automatically detect cases where you return\n    a [`HashUpdate`](#HashUpdate) which would set the same location that is\n    already set, and do nothing. Thus, you don't need to try to detect that\n    yourself.\n\n    The content of the individual strings is up to you ... essentially it\n    should be something that your `location2action` function can deal with.\n\n*   `location2action` is a function which takes a `List String` and returns\n    a list of actions your app can perform.\n\n    The argument is a normalized version of the hash portion of the location.\n    First, the `prefix` is stripped from the hash, and then the result is\n    converted to a `List String` by using '/' as a delimiter. Then, each\n    `String` value is uriDecoded.\n\n    Essentially, your `location2action` should return actions that are the\n    reverse of what your `delta2update` function produced. That is, the\n    `List String` you get back in `location2action` is the `List String` that\n    your `delta2update` used to create a [`HashUpdate`](#HashUpdate). So,\n    however you encoded your state in `delta2update`, you now need to interpret\n    that in `location2action` in order to return actions which will produce the\n    desired state.\n\n    Note that the list of actions you return will often be a single action. It\n    is a `List action` so that you can return multiple actions, if your app is\n    modular in a way that requires multiple actions to produce the desired\n    state.\n\n*   The remaining functions (`init`, `update`, `subscriptions` and `view`)\n    have the same meaning as they do in\n    [`Html.App.program`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/1.0.0/Html-App#program)\n    ... that is, you should provide what you normally provide to that function.\n",

In that case, we can\navoid creating a spurious duplicate entry in the browser's history.\n\nThe reason we take a `String` (rather than a more structured type) is that\nthere may be several ways you might want to build up the required URL. We\ndon't want to be prescriptive about that. However, the `String` you provide\nmust follow a couple of rules.\n\n* The `String` must already be uri-encoded.\n\n* The `String` must either start with a '/', a `?' or a '#'.\n\n    * If it starts with a '/', it will be interpreted as a full path, including\n      optional query parameters and hash.\n\n    * If it starts with a '?', then we'll assume that you want the current\n      path to stay the same -- only the query parameters and hash will change.\n\n    * If it starts with a '#', then we'll assume that you want the current\n      path and query parameters (if any) to stay the same -- only the\n      hash will change.\n\nSo, what you should *not* provide is the scheme, host, or authentication\nmethod -- that is, no \"http://elm-lang.org\". You should also not use relative\nURLs. (Let me know if you'd like relative URLs -- we might be able to do\nsomething sensible with them, but we don't yet in this version).\n\nOne way to construct a `UrlChange` in a modular way is to use the\n`RouteUrl.Builder` module. However, a variety of approaches are possible.\n",
