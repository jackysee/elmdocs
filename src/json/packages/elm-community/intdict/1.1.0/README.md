# IntDict [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elm-community/intdict.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/elm-community/intdict)

`IntDict` is an optimized version of a `Dict` with `Int` as key type. 

Its API is the same as `Dict`'s, so it can be regarded as a drop-in replacement.
If you are comfortable with `Dict`, working with `IntDict` should be a breeze!

For details about runtimes and important caveats with respect to JavaScript's number type, see the module documentation for [`IntDict`](./IntDict).
