# Elm FormBuilder

Elm FormBuilder is an incredible and funny way to create outstanding web forms. The API is extracted from rushout.co.
It is built to be easily extensible, using a beautiful plugin system.

Two modules have already been developed for it:

- [Elm FieldBuilder Photo](https://github.com/elm-bodybuilder/formbuilder-photo)
- [Elm FieldBuilder Autocomplete](https://github.com/elm-bodybuilder/formbuilder-autocomplete)

PS : See you at [Elm Europe](https://elmeurope.org)!
