The function takes a function and a starting element. It applies the function to the element. If the result is `Just (a, b)`, `a` is accumulated and the function is applied to `b`. If the result is `Nothing`, the list accumulated so far is returned.\n\n    unfoldr (\\b -> if b == 0 then Nothing else Just (b, b-1)) 5 == [5,4,3,2,1]\n",
