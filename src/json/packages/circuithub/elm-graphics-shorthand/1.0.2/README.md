# Shorthand for working with Graphics
Experimental package with scale-aware convenience functions for working with the Graphics modules in [Elm][elm-core]. By scale-aware we mean that the shorthands tend to be written in a way which makes 1px line/outline-styling easy and independent of the scale at which you happen to be drawing a primitive.
Note that this API is highly experimental and likely to go through many more iterations.

Feedback and contributions are very welcome!
