# Elm Plot Rouge

Hi! If you're looking to a plotting library, then
use [elm-plot](https://github.com/terezka/elm-plot) instead, because this library is not
made to be user friendly. If you feel like you're missing something in elm-plot,
you're welcome to open an issue in the repo and I'll see what I can do
to accommodate your needs!
