or by manually adding `abadi199/elm-creditcard` to your `elm-package.json`.

## How to Use

This component implements [The Elm Architecture (TEA)](http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/index.html), so if you're application also implements TEA, then using this components is simply by adding it to be part of your `view`, `update`, and `Model`.

You can use this component in two ways; one is by rendering the whole form together, or rendering each input fields and card individually.

**Example of rendering the whole form:**
```elm
import CreditCard.Model
import CreditCard.Update
import CreditCard.View
import Html.App

type alias Model =
    { creditCard : CreditCard.Model.Model CreditCard.Update.Msg
      ...
    }

init =
    { creditCard = CreditCard.Model.init CreditCard.Model.defaultOptions
      ...
    }

view model = 
    form [] 
        [ Html.App.map CardUpdate CreditCard.View.form 
        ...
        ]

type Msg = CreditCardMsg CreditCard.Update.Msg

update msg model =
    case msg of
        CreditCardMsg creditCardMsg ->
            let
                ( creditCardModel, creditCardCmd ) =
                    CreditCard.Update.update creditCardMsg model.creditCard
            in
                ( { model | creditCard = creditCardModel }
                , Cmd.map CreditCardMsg creditCardCmd 
                )
        ...
```
You can see the full code for this in this [example](https://github.com/abadi199/elm-creditcard/blob/master/src/Examples/CheckoutForm.elm)

**Example of rendering each sub-components individually:**
```elm
import CreditCard.Model
import CreditCard.Update
import CreditCard.View
import Html.App

type alias Model =
    { creditCard : CreditCard.Model.Model CreditCard.Update.Msg 
      ...
    }
    
init =
    { creditCard = CreditCard.Model.init CreditCard.Model.defaultOptions
      ...
    }
    
view model = 
    form [] 
        [ Html.App.map CreditCardMsg (CreditCard.View.cardView model.creditCard)
        , p []
            [ label [ for "CreditCardNumber" ] [ text "Number" ]
            , App.map CreditCardMsg 
                (CreditCard.View.numberInput "CreditCardNumber" model.creditCard)
            ]
        , p []
            [ label [ for "CreditCardName" ] [ text "Name" ]
            , App.map CreditCardMsg 
                (CreditCard.View.nameInput "CreditCardName" [ class "input-control" ] model.creditCard)
            ]
        , p []
            [ label [ for "CreditCardNumber" ] [ text "Expiration Date" ]
            , App.map CreditCardMsg 
                (CreditCard.View.monthInput "CreditCardMonth" model.creditCard)
            , App.map CreditCardMsg 
                (CreditCard.View.yearInput "CreditCardYear" model.creditCard)
            ]
        , p []
            [ label [ for "CreditCardCcv" ] [ text "Number" ]
            , App.map CreditCardMsg 
                (CreditCard.View.ccvInput "CreditCardCcv" model.creditCard)
            ]
        ...
        ]

type Msg = CreditCardMsg CreditCard.Update.Msg

update msg model =
    case msg of
        CreditCardMsg creditCardMsg ->
            let
                ( creditCardModel, creditCardCmd ) =
                    CreditCard.Update.update creditCardMsg model.creditCard
            in
                ( { model | creditCard = creditCardModel }
                , Cmd.map CreditCardMsg creditCardCmd 
                )
        ...
```
You can see the full code for this in this [example](https://github.com/abadi199/elm-creditcard/blob/master/src/Examples/CheckoutFormWithFields.elm)
