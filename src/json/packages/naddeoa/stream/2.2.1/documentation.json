    "comment": " A `Stream` is kind of like a stream in Java 8 and kind of like a lazy list. It is a\npotentially infinite stream of items that can be transformed and collected back into\nother structures.\n\nThis library was made because Elm currently doesn't have great options for\nlazyiness. There are a few implementations that exist but they are vulnerable\nto stack overflows. This library uses tail call recursion for collecting\nstreams into lists. Also, instead of modeling the streams recursively it uses\nan approach closer to the Elm architecture. The `Lazy` core library is not\nused. The deepest stack you will have is equal to the amount of transformations\nyou apply on a stream.  For example, in the following snippet:\n\n    let\n        finalStream =\n            Stream.fibonocci\n                |> Stream.limit 100\n                |> Stream.filter isEven\n                |> Stream.map toString\n\nEvery time `next` is called on `finalStream` a stack of size three is generated\nbefore a value can be returned. It scales with the number of transforms, not\nthe size of the list. You would have to apply a high enough number of\ntransforms to a stream in order to get a stack overflow. That number is\nhigh enough that you won't have to worry about it. That said, in other\nlibraries when you attempt to turn an infinite stream into a list you get a\nstack overflow. In this library, it will just run forever, so, keep that in\nmind.\n\nOne useful difference from Java 8 streams that we get just for being functional is\nstream reuse. Things like the following are possible now.\n\n    let\n        baseStream =\n            Stream.naturalNumbers\n                |> Stream.limit 10\n\n        firstList =\n            Stream.toList baseStream\n\n        list =\n            baseStream\n                |> Stream.map toString\n                |> Stream.toList\n\nThis is obvious to anyone who feels comfortable with functional programming, but if\nyou're coming from Java 8 then you're aware that you can't reuse streams\nthat have been collected.\n\n# Types\n@docs Stream\n\n# Operations on streams\n@docs limit, reduce, filter, drop, takeWhile, dropWhile, isEmpty, map, map2, fibonocci, zip\n\n# Getting things out of streams\n@docs next, nextN, toList\n\n# Creating streams\n@docs fromList, value, singleton, range, iterate, cycle, concat\n\n# Special streams\n@docs naturalNumbers, empty\n\n# Async stream stuff\n@docs StreamResult, deferNext, deferNextN, every\n",
