# warning

This is an experimental fork of
[jasonmahr's project](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jasonmahr/html-escape-sequences/latest)
to determine if I can resolve a dependency conflict.

I have no idea if this will work
and am making no guarantees whatsoever that I will support this repo,
or indeed ever look at it again.

# html-escape-sequences

Use HTML escape sequences with elm-lang/html.

Just replace `Html.text` with the included `text'` function.

Supports all Unicode characters and recognizes decimal, hexadecimal and named escape sequences.

No more hunting around for Unicode symbols! Also useful when fetching escaped Unicode entities from an API.
