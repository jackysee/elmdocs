All of the function signatures end in\n`Move -> Maybe (Update m msg)` so they can be partially applied and used with\n`Scroll.handle`.\n\n## Basic\n@docs onUp, onDown\n\n## Complex\n@docs onCrossUp, onCrossDown, onCrossOver, onInRange, onOverlap\n\n# Helpers for Creating On Event Handlers\nYou can create your own as well which can be used with handle as long\nthey end in `Move -> Maybe (Update m msg)`. These are some functions that\ncan aid in the creation of them.\n\n@docs direction, crossing\n",
