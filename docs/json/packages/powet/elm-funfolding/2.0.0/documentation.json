[foldlFun](#foldlFun) uses a accumulator function which is used to compose all the functions provided with the function list.\n\n# funFolding\n\nas an example, imagine you want to filter a list of integers [-100..100] using the following predicates:\n  - (\\x->x/=0)\n  - (\\x->x>(-20))\n  - (\\x->x<20)\n  - (\\x->(rem x 10) == 0)\n\nThe expected result is : [-10,10]\n\nWe foldl all the predicates using the (&&) operator, the outcome is a single predicate function that we use in [List.filter](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/List#filter)\n\nThe folding function that we use is defined by:\n\n    andN : List (a->Bool) -> a -> Bool\n    andN =\n      foldlFun (&&) False\n\nthis function can be used the following way:\n\n    test \"Compare with 4 predicates\" <|\n        \\() ->\n         let           \n           fun = andN [ (\\x->x/=0)\n                      , (\\x->x>(-20))\n                      , (\\x->x<20)\n                      , (\\x->(rem x 10) == 0)\n                      ]\n           result = List.filter fun [-100..100]\n           expected = [-10,10]\n         in\n           (Expect.equal result expected)\n\n# base functions\n@docs foldlFun, foldlFun2\n\n# specialized functions\n@docs compareN, andN ,orN \n",
