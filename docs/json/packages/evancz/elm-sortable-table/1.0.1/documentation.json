This way you are free to change your data without worrying about the table\n&ldquo;getting out of sync&rdquo; with the data. Having a single source of\ntruth is pretty great!\n\nI recommend checking out the [examples][] to get a feel for how it works.\n\n[examples]: https://github.com/evancz/elm-sortable-table/tree/master/examples\n\n# View\n\n@docs view\n\n# Configuration\n\n@docs config, stringColumn, intColumn, floatColumn\n\n# State\n\n@docs State, initialSort\n\n\n# Crazy Customization\n\nIf you are new to this library, you can probably stop reading here. After this\npoint are a bunch of ways to customize your table further. If it does not\nprovide what you need, you may just want to write a custom table yourself. It\nis not that crazy.\n\n## Custom Columns\n\n@docs Column, customColumn, veryCustomColumn,\n  Sorter, unsortable, increasingBy, decreasingBy,\n  increasingOrDecreasingBy, decreasingOrIncreasingBy\n\n## Custom Tables\n\n@docs Config, customConfig, Customizations, HtmlDetails, Status,\n  defaultCustomizations\n",
