Furthermore, the y-axis points up,\nso moving a form 10 units in the y-axis will move it up on screen.\n\n# Unstructured Graphics\n@docs collage, Form\n\n# Creating Forms\n@docs toForm, filled, textured, gradient, outlined, traced, text, outlinedText\n\n# Transforming Forms\n@docs move, moveX, moveY, scale, rotate, alpha\n\n# Grouping Forms\nGrouping forms makes it easier to write modular graphics code.
