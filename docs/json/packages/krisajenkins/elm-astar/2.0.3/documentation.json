You must\n  supply a cost function and a move function.\n\n  The cost function must estimate the distance between any two\n  positions. It doesn't really matter how accurate this estimate is,\n  as long as it *never* underestimates.\n\n  The move function takes a `Position` and returns a `Set` of possible\n  places you can move to in one step.\n\n  If this function returns `Nothing`, there is no path between the two\n  points. Otherwise it returns `Just` a `List` of steps from `start`\n  to `end`.\n\n  Example usage.\n\n     import AStar exposing (..)\n\n\n     type World =\n         ...your custom code...\n\n\n     movesFrom : World -> Position -> Set Position\n     movesFrom world (x,y) =\n         ...your custom code...\n\n\n     findPath\n         straightLineCost\n         (movesFrom currentWorld)\n         ( 0, 0 ) ( 2, 0 )\n     --> Just [ ( 1, 0 ), ( 2, 0 ) ]\n",
