# SparseVector a minimal sparse vector implementation

Copyright (c) 2016 Robin Luiten

This a minimal sparse vector implementation that I needed for Lunrelm.

It maybe of value to others so I split it out.

Its functionally may increase over time as needed.

You are welcome to contribute additional functionality, it is highly
desirable to have at least a test for new functions.
