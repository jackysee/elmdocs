    "comment": " This modules provides an opaque type for Uuids, helpers to serialize\nfrom and to String and helpers to generate new Uuids using Max Goldsteins\nRandom.PCG pseudo-random generator library.\n\nUuids are Universally Unique IDentifiers. They are 128 bit ids that are\ndesigned to be extremely unlikely to collide with other Uuids.\n\nThis library only supports generating Version 4 Uuid (those generated using\nrandom numbers, as opposed to hashing. See\n[Wikipedia on Uuids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_.28random.29)\nfor more details). Version 4 Uuids are constructed using 122 pseudo random bits.\n\nDisclaimer: If you use this Library to generate Uuids, please be advised\nthat it does not use a cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator.\nWhile Random.PCG is a definite improvement over Elms native RNG, depending\non your use case the randomness provided may not be enough.\n\nThis library is split into two Modules. Uuid (this module) wraps Uuids in\nan opaque type for improved type safety. If you prefer to simply get strings\nyou can use the Uuid.Barebones module which provides methods to generate\nand verify Uuid as plain Strings.\n\nUuids can be generated either by parsing them from the canonical string representation\n(see fromString) or by generating them. If you are unfamiliar with random number generation\nin pure functional languages, this can be a bit confusing. The gist of it is that:\n\n1. you need a good random seed and this has to come from outside our wonderfully\npredictable Elm code (meaning you have to create an incoming port and feed in\nsome initial randomness)\n\n2. every call to generate a new Uuid will give you a tuple of a Uuid and a new\nseed. It is very important that whenever you generate a new Uuid you store this\nseed you get back into your model and use this one for the next Uuid generation.\nIf you reuse a seed, you will create the same Uuid twice!\n\nHave a look at the examples in the package to see how to use it!\n\n@docs Uuid, uuidGenerator, fromString, toString\n",
