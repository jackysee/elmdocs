# elm-emoji
> A searchable emoji database

This is a simple Elm package that collects all of the emoji into a module and
provides a means of searching the database for a given emoji. I'm using it in an
emoji picker package I'm working on.

## Example

There's an example with an emoji picker in the `example` directory.

```sh
cd example
elm-reactor
```

## NOTE

There are presently emoji missing from this package. This is due to [this issue
on elm-compiler](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/issues/1585). I'll
look into other ways to make this work in the meantime, but wanted to get a
version out.
