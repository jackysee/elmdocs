The module defines four common alert levels (success,\ninfo, warning and error) and takes care of managing toast lifecycles.\n\nSee the [demo](https://ktorz.github.io/elm-notification) to get a nice overview of the capability.\n\n# Create a notification\n\nTo create a notification, just send a `Notification` to the provided signal address. This can be\ndone either by directly calling `Signal.send` or, by using events subscriber from the `Html.Events`\nmodule.\n\n@docs Notification, success, info, warning, error, address\n\n# Display and run effects\n\nTo be able to run and to actually work, notifications need to be added to your view. A `Signal Html`\nis available for that purpose as well as a `Signal (Task Effects.Never ())` ready to be plugged in a\nport, or merged with on of your application effects signal.\n\n@docs view, task\n",
