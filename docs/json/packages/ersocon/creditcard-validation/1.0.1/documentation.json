This implementation may change in future. API will stay\nas is.\n\nThe main use case is the validation of credit card numbers entered by users in\nan input field. To avoid dependencies to parser libraries there is no\nfunction with the signature of String -> Bool.\n\n# Definition\n@docs isValid\n\n",
