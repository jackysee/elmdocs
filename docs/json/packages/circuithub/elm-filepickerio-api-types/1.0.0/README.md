# Some basic schema for working with Filepicker.io
Experimental package with types for assisting with the [filepicker.io](https://developers.filepicker.io) API. Unfortunately this package does not come with an actual FFI to work with Filepicker. I've only published this in the hopes of helping out the next person who decides to dive in and create bindings for Filepicker.
