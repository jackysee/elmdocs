elm-mouse-events
================

The `MouseEvents` module offers mouse event handlers for elm that offer more information that the ones included in the core modules; allowing things like determining where an element was clicked instead of just getting notified about clicks.

More details can be found in the documentation at http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mbr/elm-mouse-events/latest.
