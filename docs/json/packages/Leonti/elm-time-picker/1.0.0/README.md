# Elm Time Picker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Leonti/elm-time-picker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Leonti/elm-time-picker)  

TimePicker will display Material Design time picker with a round clock face  

TimePicker does not come with a dialog, so it can be embedded inside of a form or can be used
with something like [elm-mdl](https://debois.github.io/elm-mdl/)
