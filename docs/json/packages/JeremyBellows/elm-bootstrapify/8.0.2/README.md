## Updating
### Disclaimer
This library is still in development so the types and names of functions may change. Always be sure to perform a diff before upgrading!
### Process
Before updating, it is recommended to perform a diff of the version you are attempting to merge and the version that is depended on.

Navigate to root directory of your project and type
```
elm-package diff JeremyBellows/elm-bootstrapify 2.0.1 8.0.1
```

Be sure to replace 2.0.1 with the version of elm-bootstrapify that is depended on.
Replace 8.0.1 with the version of elm-bootstrapify that you want to use.

If the diff is desirable, then change the version number of elm-bootrapify in `elm-package.json`.

It should look like
```
"JeremyBellows/elm-bootstrapify": "8.0.0 <= v < 9.0.0",
```

Execute the following command
```
elm package install JeremyBellows/elm-bootstrapify
```
