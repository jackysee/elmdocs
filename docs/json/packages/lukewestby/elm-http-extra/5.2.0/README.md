[![ICARE](https://icarebadge.com/ICARE-white.png)](https://icarebadge.com)

Extra helpers for more easily building and handling Http requests that require
greater configuration than what is provided by `elm-http` out of the box.


> Thanks to @fredcy, @rileylark, and @etaque for the original discussion of the
  API

## Example

In this example, we expect a successful response to be JSON array of strings,
like:

```json
["hello", "world", "this", "is", "the", "best", "json", "ever"]
```

and an error response might have a body which just includes text, such as the
following for a 404 error:

```json
Not Found.
```

We'll use `HttpExtra.jsonReader` and a `Json.Decode.Decoder` to parse the
successful response body and `HttpExtra.stringReader` to accept a string
body on error without trying to parse JSON.

```elm
import Time
import Http.Extra as HttpExtra exposing (..)
import Json.Decode as Json


itemsDecoder : Json.Decoder (List String)
itemsDecoder =
  Json.list Json.string


addItem : String -> Task (HttpExtra.Error String) (HttpExtra.Response (List String))
addItem item =
  HttpExtra.post "http://example.com/api/items"
    |> withStringBody ("{ \"item\": \"" ++ item ++ "\" }")
    |> withHeader "Content-Type" "application/json"
    |> withTimeout (10 * Time.second)
    |> withCredentials
    |> send (jsonReader itemsDecoder) stringReader
```
