# elm-graphql

`elm-graphql` aims to generate Elm code for making GraphQL queries in a type-safe manner.
It's being developed at the bimonthly [Elm Hackathon](http://www.meetup.com/Elm-user-group-SF/).
Contributions are welcome.

This prototype consists of a code generator which takes GraphQL schema and named queries in a
.graphql file and generates corresponding Elm types. The schema is obtained by introspection
of a live GraphQL server.

The type of each query is a single large record. We do not generate type aliases for each "object",
because GraphQL allows different fields to be selected for the same type at different nesting
levels within the same query. Elm's extensible records mean that there's really no reason to want
to do this anyway.

We use Facebook's [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) to parse a GraphQL
schema.

## Build

    cd tool
    npm install

This builds the code generator, but you'll need to check out my demo project to actually use it, see below.
    
## Demo

Check out my [elm-graphql-demo](https://github.com/jahewson/elm-graphql-demo) which provides a sample application and includes full build instructions.

## How it works

See the wiki page, [how elm-graphql works](https://github.com/jahewson/elm-graphql/wiki/How-elm-graphql-works) for more details.
