# Keyboard Extra

Copy of https://github.com/ohanhi/keyboard-extra.

All credit goes to him, I just wanted some minor changes, and I noticed there
were no responses to issues from months ago.

A few super minor changes that I found annoying:
- Msg now exposed: https://github.com/ohanhi/keyboard-extra/issues/14
- Update/Init doesnt pair with Cmd.none: https://github.com/ohanhi/keyboard-extra/issues/17
