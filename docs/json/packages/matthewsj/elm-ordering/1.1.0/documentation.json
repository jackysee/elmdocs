    "comment": " Library for building comparison functions.\n\nThis library makes it easy to create comparison functions for arbitary types by composing\nsmaller comparison functions. For instance, suppose you are defining a data type to represent\na standard deck of cards. You might define it as:\n\n    type alias Card = { value : Value, suite : Suite }\n    type Suite = Clubs | Hearts | Diamonds | Spades\n    type Value = Two | Three | Four | Five | Six | Seven\n               | Eight | Nine | Ten | Jack | Queen | King | Ace\n\nWith this representation, you could define an ordering for `Card` values compositionally:\n\n    import Ordering exposing (Ordering)\n\n\n    cardOrdering : Ordering Card\n    cardOrdering =\n        Ordering.byFieldWith suiteOrdering .suite\n            |> Ordering.breakTiesWith\n                   (Ordering.byFieldWith valueOrdering .value)\n\n\n    suiteOrdering : Ordering Suite\n    suiteOrdering =\n        Ordering.explicit [Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades]\n\n\n    valueOrdering : Ordering Value\n    valueOrdering =\n        Ordering.explicit\n            [ Two , Three , Four , Five , Six , Seven\n            , Eight, Nine, Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace\n            ]\n\n\nYou can then use this ordering to sort cards, make comparisons, and so on. For instance,\nto sort a deck of cards you can use `cardOrdering` directly:\n\n    sortCards : List Card -> List Card\n    sortCards = List.sortWith cardOrdering\n\n# Definition\n@docs Ordering\n\n# Construction\n@docs natural, byToString, explicit, byField, byFieldWith, byRank, noConflicts, ifStillTiedThen\n\n# Composition\n@docs breakTiesWith, reverse\n\n# Utility\n@docs isOrdered, greaterThanBy, lessThanBy\n",

The rule is\nthat all items are sorted first by rank, and then using the given within-rank\nordering for items of the same rank.\n\nThis function is intended for use with types that have multiple cases where\nconstructors for some or all of the cases take arguments. (Otherwise use `Ordering.explicit`\ninstead which has a simpler interface.) For instance, to make an ordering for\na type such as:\n\n    type JokerCard = NormalCard Value Suite | Joker\n\nyou could use `byRank` to sort all the normal cards before the jokers like so:\n\n    jokerCardOrdering : Ordering JokerCard\n    jokerCardOrdering =\n        Ordering.byRank\n            (card ->\n                 case card of\n                     NormalCard _ _ -> 1\n                     Joker -> 2)\n            (x y ->\n                 case (x, y) of\n                     (NormalCard v1 s1, NormalCard v2 s2) ->\n                         suiteOrdering s1 s2\n                             |> Ordering.ifStillTiedThen\n                                    (valueOrdering v1 v2)\n                     _ -> Ordering.noConflicts)\n\nMore generally, the expected pattern is that for each case in your type, you assign\nthat case to a unique rank with the ranking function. Then for your within-rank\nordering, you have a case statement that enumerates all the \"tie\" states and\nspecifies how to break ties, and then uses a catch-all case that returns\n`Ordering.noConflicts` to specify that all remaining cases cannot give rise to\nthe need to do any subcomparisons. (This can be either because the values being\ncompared have no internal structure and so are always equal, or because they are\nconstructors with different ranks and so will never be compared by this function.)\n",
