# Trinary

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic),
Trinary logic (also known as three-valued, trivalent, ternary, or
trilean, sometimes abbreviated 3VL) is any of several many-valued
logic systems in which there are three truth values indicating
*true*, *false* and some *indeterminate* third value. This is
contrasted with the more commonly known bivalent logics (such as
classical sentential or Boolean logic) which provide only for
*true* and *false*.
