# UniqueList, A type to arrange things in order

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Chadtech/unique-list.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Chadtech/unique-list)


A `UniqueList` is like a list, but it cannot have duplicate entries. It is also like a `Set`, except the elements are in order.
