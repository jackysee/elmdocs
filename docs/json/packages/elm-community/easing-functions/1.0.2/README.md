# Easing Functions

An **easing function** is used in animation to make a transition between two values appear more lifelike or interesting.
Easing functions can make sliding panels or bouncing menus appear to be physical objects.

This library provides an Elm implementation of the functions listed on [easings.net](http://easings.net/), and a few
helper functions to help you build up your own custom easing functions.

Search the [package catalog](http://package.elm-lang.org/) for `animation` to find libraries that use easing functions.
