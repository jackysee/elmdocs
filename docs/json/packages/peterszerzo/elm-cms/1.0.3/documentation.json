    "comment": " This library creates a minimalistic content management interface based solely on a detailed definition of records and fields to work with. Connects to a REST API.\n\nIt works something like the following:\n\n*client: I want to edit jobs with a text title and a markdown content. I have some custom validations and default values too. Oh, and I also have a REST API at this URL. I'm already authenticating users and have access to their names in client-side JavaScript.*\n\n*elm-cms: Super cool! Just use my types to declare your records, and pass the rest to me as flags. Hope you like minimalistic!*\n\nThis library tries to be simple. It supports:\n* input, textarea and radio fields\n* a markdown editor\n* an image uploader widget (must subscribe to port to handle the upload and send back the uploaded image URL)\n* for the time being, it stores all data as a string. Other data types have to be encoded as strings and converted by the users of the API. Hang in there while I think through a nice way to handle numbers, booleans and maybe possible even JSON\n\nIt will conceivably support:\n* lists (stored as a stringified array of strings)\n* yaml editor (if I can pull off writing a `peterszerzo/elm-yaml` package)\n* two basic roles: editor, who may edit records, and an admin, who may also create and edit records\n* trash\n\nIt is unlikely it will ever support:\n* auth logic. This app should start once the cms user is already logged in and the auth token or cookie is already set\n* drafts and versions\n\n\n# Definitions\n@docs Record, Config, defaultConfig, Model, Flags, Msg\n\n# The program\n@docs programWithFlags\n",
