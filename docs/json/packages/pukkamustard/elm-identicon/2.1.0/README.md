# elm-identicon
Generate a visual hash from a string (aka identicons).

This was intended to be an Elm port of [identicon.js](https://github.com/stewartlord/identicon.js). However it was easier to just use an alternative hash method (not md5). The generated identicons are not compatible with identicon.js (i.e. it will produce different images for same input).

## Example

See `example/` folder.
