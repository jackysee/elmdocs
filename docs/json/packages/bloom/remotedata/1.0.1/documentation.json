    "comment": " A datatype representing fetched data.\n\nIf you find yourself continually using `Maybe (Result Error a)` to\nrepresent loaded data, or you have a habit of shuffling errors away to\nwhere they can be quietly ignored, consider using this. It makes it\neasier to represent the real state of a remote data fetch and handle\nit properly.\n\n\nFor more on the motivation, take a look at the blog post [How Elm Slays A UI Antipattern](http://blog.jenkster.com/2016/06/how-elm-slays-a-ui-antipattern.html).\n\n\nTo use the datatype, let's look at an example that loads `News` from a feed.\n\nFirst you add to your model, wrapping the data you want in `WebData`:\n\n\n``` elm\ntype alias Model =\n    { news : WebData News }\n```\n\nThen add in a message that will deliver the response:\n\n``` elm\ntype alias Msg\n    = NewsResponse (WebData News)\n```\n\nNow we can create an HTTP get:\n\n``` elm\ngetNews : Cmd Msg\ngetNews =\n    Http.get decodeNews \"/news\"\n        |> RemoteData.asCmd\n        |> Cmd.map NewsResponse\n\n```\n\nWe trigger it in our `init` function:\n\n``` elm\ninit : ( Model, Cmd Msg)\ninit =\n    ( { news = Loading }\n    , getNews\n    )\n```\n\nWe handle it in our `update` function:\n\n``` elm\nupdate msg model =\n    case msg of\n        NewsResponse response ->\n            ( { model | news = response }\n            , Cmd.none\n            )\n```\n\n\nMost of this you'd already have in your app, and the changes are just\nwrapping the datatype in `Webdata`, and updating the `Http.get` call\nto add in `RemoteData.asCmd`.\n\nNow we get to where we really want to be, rendering the data and\nhandling the different states in the UI gracefully:\n\n\n``` elm\nview : Model -> Html msg\nview model =\n  case model.news of\n    NotAsked -> text \"Initialising.\"\n\n    Loading -> text \"Loading.\"\n\n    Failure err -> text (\"Error: \" ++ toString err)\n\n    Success news -> viewNews news\n\n\nviewNews : News -> Html msg\nviewNews news =\n    div []\n        [h1 [] [text \"Here is the news.\"]\n        , ...]\n```\n\nAnd that's it. A more accurate model of what's happening leads to a better UI.\n\n@docs RemoteData\n@docs WebData\n@docs map\n@docs mapFailure\n@docs mapBoth\n@docs andThen\n@docs withDefault\n@docs fromResult\n@docs toMaybe\n@docs asCmd\n@docs fromTask\n@docs append\n@docs isSuccess\n@docs isFailure\n@docs isLoading\n@docs isNotAsked\n@docs update\n@docs pure\n@docs apply\n@docs (<$>)\n@docs (<*>)\n@docs prism\n\n",
