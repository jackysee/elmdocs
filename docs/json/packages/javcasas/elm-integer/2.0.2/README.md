# elm-integer
Here lies a library for Elm that allows you to operate on Integers (like the Haskell or Python ones).
These Integers have no bounds other than the memory on your device, so you should be able
to do millions of digits without difficulty.

Bear in mind the arithmetic is slower than with native Ints.

## Usage
Add it to your elm-package.json. Import Data.Integer.

## Bugs, improvements and contributions
