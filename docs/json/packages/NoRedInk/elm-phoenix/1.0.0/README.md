## Channels

The modules under `Phoenix.Channel` are designed for working with websockets, which Phoenix calls channels. Channels are pretty similiar to Socket.io's namespacing for rooms and events. [elm-blogger](https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-blogger/tree/master/web/static/elm) contains example usage!
