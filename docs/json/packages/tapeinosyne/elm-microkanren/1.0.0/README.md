# μKanren
The `microkanren` package is a dependency-free Elm implementation of the eponymous relational programming language *μKanren*, as described by Hemann and Friedmann in [µKanren: A Minimal Functional Core
for Relational Programming](http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf).

This module only provides a barebone typed foundation upon which it is possible to build larger languages in the [miniKanren family](http://www.minikanren.org), and lacks much of the convenience user-facing libraries rightfully require.
