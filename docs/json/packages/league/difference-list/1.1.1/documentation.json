Internally, `DList`\nis a function that prepends elements to its parameter. Thus the `append`\noperation is just function composition. Ultimately, a `DList` is converted to a\nregular `List` by applying the function to the empty list.\n\nSome limitations of the `DList` representation are:\n\n  - We cannot ask for the length of a `DList` without converting it to a\n    regular list.\n\n  - We cannot test equality on two `DList` structures without converting them\n    to regular lists.\n\n@docs DList, toList\n\n# Construction\n@docs empty, singleton, cons, snoc, append, (+&+), fromList\n\n# Processing\n@docs concat, foldr, intersperse, map\n\n",
