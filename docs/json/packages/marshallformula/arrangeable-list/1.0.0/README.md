# arrangeable-list

An `ArrangeableList` is sort of like a zip-list except the item in focus moves within the list - instead of moving the focus itself.

This is useful when you need to move a single item around within a list one step at a time.

## Installation

```bash
elm-package install marshallformula/arrangeable-list
```

See the docs & examples for usage info.
