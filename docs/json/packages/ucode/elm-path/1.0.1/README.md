# Filepath manipulation library for elm

This is a fork of [JustusAdam/elm-path](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/JustusAdam/elm-path/1.3.0). It has been brought up to date with Elm version 0.18.0. The native portion of the library for detecting the current platform has been removed.

This is largely a rewrite of the `filepath` Haskell package.

Not all functions have been moved over yet, a lot of Windows Drive specific functionality does not work yet, which makes especially the Windows part of this package very experimental.

Help with finishing it is appreciated.
