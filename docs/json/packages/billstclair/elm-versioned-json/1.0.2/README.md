Sometimes you need to save all or part of your Model, either in the HTML DOM's `localStorage`, or in a database, or both. But you also often need to change that Model, usually by adding properties. This module makes it easier to save versioned data as strings, and to convert older saved versions to the most recent version.

See the README for the [examples](https://github.com/billstclair/elm-versioned-json/tree/master/examples) directory for details.
