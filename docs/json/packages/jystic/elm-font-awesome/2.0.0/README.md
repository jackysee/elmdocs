# Font Awesome for Elm

Use the incredible [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) vector
icon library without leaving the comfort of your Elm environment.

This library exposes scalable vector icons as Elm HTML components. If
you need to use them as Elements, try the 'toElement' function from
'elm-html'.

Check out the Font Awesome website linked above to see what the icons
look like.
