Please do not trust them\nwhen statisical or especially cryptographic randomness is required.\n\nFor best results, invoke `Random.initialSeed` only once in your program, and\nthread the returned new seeds through. For a good random seed, evaluate\n`Math.floor(Math.random()*0xFFFFFFFF)` either once and hard-code the result, or\nas the value of `port initialSeed : Int`.\n\n\n@docs sample, choose, shuffle\n\n",
