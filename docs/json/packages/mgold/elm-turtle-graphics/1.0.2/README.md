#Elm Turtle Graphics

## Getting Started
Tell the turtle where to go using the basic Turtle module. For example,

````elm
import Turtle exposing (..)

steps = [forward 20, left 90, forward 10]
main = animate steps
````

## Advanced Users
Those already comfortable with Elm should look at the Advanced module.
