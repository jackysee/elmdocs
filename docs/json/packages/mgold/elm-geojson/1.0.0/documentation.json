Most of this module defines types\nthat collectively define that data structure.\n\nAfter using `GeoJson.decoder` you can either traverse the data structure\ndirectly (recommended if you're working with 2D positions and not using\nproperties) or use `Json.Decode.andThen` to transform it into a more convenient\nrepresentation specific to your use case (recommended if you find yourself with\na lot of Maybes or impossible cases using the first approach). Also, GeoJSON\nobjects may contain nonstandard top-level fields; you can run multiple decoders\nusing `Json.Decode.object2` the way you'd use `map2`.\n\nAn `encode` function is also provided, mostly for completeness and testing.\nNeither encoding nor decoding attempt to enforce minimum array lengths\n(excluding positions, whose minimum length is enforced by their type).\n\n# Decoder\n@docs decoder\n\n# Elm Representation of GeoJSON\nAll union types are fully exposed so you can inspect them as necessary.\n@docs GeoJson, GeoJsonObject, FeatureObject, Geometry, Position,  Bbox\n\n# Encoding\n@docs encode\n",
