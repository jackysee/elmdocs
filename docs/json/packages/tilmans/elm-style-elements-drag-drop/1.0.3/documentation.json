    "comment": " This library handles dragging and dropping using the API\nfrom the HTML 5 recommendation at\n<https://www.w3.org/TR/html/editing.html#drag-and-drop>.\n\nIt provides attributes and a model/update to handle\ndragging and dropping between your elements.\n\nTypes are parametrized with a `dragId` and a `dropId` parameter, which are the\ntypes for the drag identifier passed to the [`draggable`](#draggable) function\nand the drop identifier passed to the [`droppable`](#droppable) function.\nYou can put whatever data you like in these, but don't use function types.\n\nYou can use several instances of this model at the same time and they won't\ninterfere with each other. Drag and drop are connected to an instance by the\nMsg constructor used, and the update function will not send a result if a drop\nwas made from another instance.\n\n\n# Model and update\n\n@docs Model, init, Msg, update, updateSticky\n\n\n# View attributes\n\n@docs draggable, droppable, draggableElement, droppableElement\n\n\n# Status functions\n\n@docs getDragId, getDropId\n\n",
