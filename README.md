[ElmDocs](http://jackysee.github.io/elmdocs)

ElmDocs is an experimental package documentation site for Elm packages, like [devdocs](http://devdocs.io).
You can enable multiple package documentations for quick search, the added documentations are stored to 
localStorage for fast access.

Currently it only provides latest version of each package. The documentations are static files updated from 
package.elm-lang.org manually. So they might not be up-to-date.
