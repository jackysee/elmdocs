ElmDocs is an experimental package documentation site for Elm packages, like [devdocs](http://devdocs.io).
You can enable multiple package documentations for quick search, the added documentations are stored to localStorage
for fast access.

Currently it only provides latest version of each package. The documentations are static so they might not
be up-to-date.
